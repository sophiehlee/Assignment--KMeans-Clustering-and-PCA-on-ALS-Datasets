# Assignment-KMeans-Clustering-and-PCA

## Description:

This was a short assignment which was part of the curriculum for a course in Predictive Analytics. It demonstrates how to group data using unsupervised learning techniques such as K-Means clustering and reduce dimensionality of datasets using Principal Component Analysis. 

## Dataset

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS (also known in the US as Lou Gehrig’s Disease and as Motor Neuron Disease in the UK) is a disease that involves the degeneration and death of thenerve cells in the brain and spinal cord that control voluntary muscle movement. Death typically occurs within 3 - 5 years of diagnosis. Only about 25% of patients survive for more than 5 years after diagnosis.

This case-study examines the patterns, symmetries, associations and causality in a rare but devastating disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).
